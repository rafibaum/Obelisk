# Obelisk
A hobby project of mine to implement a Minecraft server in Rust. Based on the latest available [protocol](https://wiki.vg) and using [Glowstone](https://github.com/GlowstoneMC/Glowstone) as reference where necessary. I've been inspired to do this for two reasons: firstly to explore a system-level programming language and secondly, to try and implement as much of a Minecraft server as possible from the ground-up to try and beat the terrible vanilla performance of recent versions. I don't expect to implement enough features for such a comparison to be valid anytime soon, but we should keep an eye on performance at all times.

## Goals
* Learn Rust
* Explore the internals of Minecraft
* Sharpen my software engineering skills

## Non-goals
* Create a server that's ready for production use
